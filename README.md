# DeepFake-Detection-using-HPC
This project detects deepfake images using a CNN with High-Performance Computing (HPC) for faster and more accurate training. It employs parallel training across multiple GPUs, Error Level Analysis (ELA) for feature extraction, and optimized data processing. Built with TensorFlow, and multi-GPU acceleration, it enhances detection efficiency.
